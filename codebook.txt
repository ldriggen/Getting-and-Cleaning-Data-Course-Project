Project Purpose and Background
==============================
The purpose of this project is to create a tidy dataset from specific manipulations of the
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. The specific manipulations required are:

	1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
        3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
        5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The R code to complete the above is to be stored in an R script called run_analysis.R .

Input data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Project
=========================================================================

There are 8 datasets used as input from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Project.

	1. subject_test.txt - contains the subject who performed the activities in the test set
        2. subject_train.txt - contains the subject who performed the activities in the training set
	3. X_test.txt - contains the feature measurements for the test set (see Features Description section below)
	4. X_train.txt - contains the feature measurements for the training set (see Features Description section below)
	5. y_test.txt - contains the labels for the test set
	6. y_train.txt - contains the labels for the training set
	7. activity_labels.txt - contains text labels for the activity codes
	8. features.txt - list of all the features (measurements - see Features Description below

Features Description (taken from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Project)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

Data Manipulation on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Project
=============================================================================

   1. input the subject_test.txt, X_test.txt, and y_text.txt datasets and column bind them together
   2. input the subject_train.txt, X_train.txt, and y_train.txt datasets and column bind them together
   3. row bind the results of 1. and 2. above to create a single dataset
   4. input the features.txt dataset and determine the columns containing means and standard deviations
   5. subset the result of step 3 to contain only the subject, activity, and the features from step 4.
   6. add activity description to the result of step 5.
   7. compute the means for all the features in the result of 7. by subject and activity description.
   8. turn the dataset in step 7 into a long dataset with each subject, activity description and feature/statistic in its own row.
   9. split the feature name into three variables, measurement, statistic, and axis (e.g "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" becomes
      "tBodyAcc", "mean()", and "X".
   10. write the result of step 9. to tidy.txt

=============================================================================
Output dataset tidy.txt
=============================================================================

 The output dataset (tidy.txt) has one row for each subject, activity, and feature containing
 a mean or standard deviation from the the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

 The columns are described below:

     subject - values 1 through 30 inclusive
     activity - values "LAYING", "SITTING", "STANDING", "WALKING", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", and "WALKING_UPSTAIRS" 
     measurement - values  "tBodyAcc"  "tGravityAcc" "tBodyAccJerk" "tBodyGyro" "tBodyGyroJerk" "tBodyAccMag"
